# Peridash

## About the Project

The Peridash project is a Stocks dashboard that fetches data from the [TwelveData API](https://twelvedata.com/). It's built with Django and React, both of which are popular and powerful frameworks for backend and frontend development respectively. The project is containerized using Docker, a platform that packages an application and its dependencies together in the form of containers to ensure that the application works seamlessly in any environment.

For package and dependency management, the project uses [PDM](https://pdm.fming.dev/), a modern Python package manager with PEP 582 support. It simplifies managing the dependencies of your Python projects.

## On going refactor

The project is currently beign refactored to use React with Vite and Supabase as the backend.
